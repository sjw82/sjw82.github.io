        <p>There are several educational issues that the school attempts to address across classes:
            socio-political inequality, access to resources, and life skills. Technology is
            integrated where possible but never assuming a student has access at home. Tutoring is
            also offered before and after school; both teacher to student and peer to peer. There is
            a second round of buses in the evening to ensure that students whose parents are unable
            to pick them up later in the day are still able to participate in extracurriculars and
            additional tutoring.</p>
        <p>The schools architecture has built in features to address bullying, such as a lack of
            isolated areas, as well as safety features in case of an intruder, including
            bullet-resistant glass and designated shelters.</p>
        <p>H.B.M. aims to support all students and families, regardless of external circumstances.
            Through work with community partners, we are able to offer vouchers for daycare and
            connect students and guardians with services such as job placements, resources for food
            security, and rehabilitation programs.</p>
