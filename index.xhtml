                <p>The Hailey B. Mothershead STEAM Magnet High School focuses on providing equity in
                    education, meeting students where they are, and providing professional and life
                    skills that students can carry with them well after they leave. Our mission is
                    to prepare students for their lives after graduation, whether they pursue higher
                    education or a career while encouraging strong ties to the community and
                    civic-mindedness. Our philosophy is to entrust students with their
                    education.</p>
                <p>H.B.M is located in Homewood, Pittsburgh, PA. By offering busing to districts
                    throughout the city and surrounding areas the school attracts a diverse
                    community of students, though students for whom this school would be zoned as
                    their local school are given priority. Admissions are conducted through a
                    lottery system; the student population is on average 1,400.</p>
                <p>There are several educational issues that the school attempts to address across
                    classes: socio-political inequality, access to resources, and life skills.
                    Technology is integrated where possible but never assuming a student has access
                    at home. It is important to us that students have the necessary skills to excel
                    at college or in industry so proficiencies with word, powerpoint, and excel as
                    well as the ability to search for and digest information, for example tutorials,
                    are stressed in most classes. Tutoring is also offered before and after school
                    both teacher to student and peer to peer. There is a second round of buses in
                    the evening to ensure that students whose parents are unable to pick them up
                    late are still able to participate in extracurriculars and additional tutoring.
                    Specific skills such as critical thinking, empathy, problem solving, and
                    discipline are developed not just through material but through class structure.
                    Students are given plenty of opportunity for self expression and to pursue their
                    individual curiosities but are held to a high standard in regards to form and
                    effort.</p>
