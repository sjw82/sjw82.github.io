        <p>Hailey B. was recently renovated using design principles rooted in our school philosophy: transparency, collaboration, and transformation. It is important to us that students have the necessary skills to excel at college or in industry so proficiencies with word, powerpoint, and excel as well as the ability to search for and digest information, e.g. tutorials, are stressed in most classes. Technology is integrated throughout the school buildings so that students have constant access to the information they need to learn and grow. WiFi is available throughout campus for use on personal devices. Outlets are available in every space. Most walls function as both projector screens and whiteboards. Pocket projectors are available for rent from the school library for students who may want to hold formal or informal presentations. We’ve found that many students utilize these as a study tool and to practice presentations for classes.</p>
        <p>Students are able to check out laptops from the school annually so that all students have access to the powerful advantages the internet can bring. Families can go through the school to receive subsidized internet in their homes.</p>
        <p>No space in the school serves only one function. The cafeteria, gym, and two main student spaces also serve as performance spaces. Hallways are broad, bright, and offer seating, broadening the classroom and encouraging students to collaborate and utilize their free time constructively. Teachers are encouraged to utilize various spaces throughout the campus. At H.B.M. learning isn’t restricted to the classroom.</p>
        <p>In regards to design, open spaces and transparency were prioritized. Classrooms contain windows into the interior of the building to create “a public conversation about teaching and learning” (David Stephen). We want our students to be able to observe and support their peers in their education. Research has also shown that open designs reduce bullying, which we’ve observed since the remodel.</p>
